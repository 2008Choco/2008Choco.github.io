        <h1>This is a temporary page! WORK IN PROGRESS!</h1>
		<p>Here you can find hotlinks to the Javadoc pages of my various SpigotMC plugins. You are welcome to take a browse, or view my projects on SpigotMC to download them for yourself. This page is going to be redesigned in the future, but at the moment, this page serves one purpose... and that is to provide hotlinks to the Javadocs for my projects.</p>
